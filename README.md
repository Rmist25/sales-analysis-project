# TechnoEdge Sales Analysis

## Overview
The TechnoEdge sales dataset provides key insights into the company's sales performance, covering metrics such as Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit. By analyzing different categories, sub-categories, and products, trends and opportunities can be identified. Additionally, columns like Order Date, Dispatch Date, and Ship Mode offer insights into logistics and supply chain management. This project aims to use Power BI for data-driven decision-making.
